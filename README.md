Made this code today, during my break between classes. This clock shows the time for us in Toronto. 
This Java Swing application creates a simple and elegant digital clock with date and day display. 
The clock features a clean user interface designed using javax.swing and java.awt. 
It utilizes SimpleDateFormat to format and display the current time, day of the week, and date.
